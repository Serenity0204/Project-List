# Project List

This repository contains a collection of projects that I've worked on. Each project is contained in its own directory along with a brief description of the project and its purpose. Feel free to explore the projects that interest you!

## Embedded System Projects
### STM32
1. **[YouLostIt PrivTag](https://github.com/Serenity0204/You-Lost-It-PrivTag)** </br>
   YouLostIt is a privacy-enabled lost-item tracker designed to help users locate misplaced belongings. The device attaches to an item (e.g., a backpack) and uses an accelerometer to detect when it has remained stationary for an extended period, signaling that it is lost.
## C System Programming Projects
1. **[Memory Allocator](https://github.com/Serenity0204/Memory-Allocator)** </br>
This project implements a simplified dynamic memory allocator in C, mimicking the behavior of `malloc` and `free`. The allocator manages a simulated heap using memory-mapped pages and supports dynamic memory requests with custom metadata handling, alignment, and block coalescing to mitigate fragmentation.

## Getting Started

To explore any of the projects, simply navigate to the respective directory and follow the instructions provided in the project's README. Each project may have specific build or execution requirements.
